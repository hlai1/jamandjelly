Welcome to â€œJam and Jelly"!

This is an app that generates editable Spotify playlists for users 
based on factors such as your favorite artist, favorite genre, and current mood. 
You can generate multiple playlists, randomize the order of songs, move songs around, and delete songs.
You can also screenshot generated playlists, and one special feature is that the app can generate 
a new playlist for you without any additional input after you've generated a playlist already. 

To run this app, run the graphics.py file. The rando.py file includes logic, but will NOT
generate anything for you (visually, at least). 

Once you're on the playlist page, in order to move songs around or delete songs, please press inside the 
corresponding text box before typing in numbers so the program knows which input you're giving 
(moving songs or deleting songs). If you're moving songs, separate the two numbers you're inputting
with a space in between (ex: to move song 9 to position 1, you'd click inside the "move" textbox
and enter "9 1").

You will need to have the spotipy API installed, and you can do so by typing 
"pip install spotipy" in your command window (works for Windows).

There are no shortcut commands for this program.
